# voice-command-system

Speech recognition has always been an exciting field of research. It involves recognition and translation of spoken language into text, automatically. It has a wide range of real-world applications. From home automation to flying fighter jets. In this project, you will not only use the text data but audio data as well. The objective of this project is to build a deep learning system to convert a speech input to text. It can be used for tasks such as controlling home automation systems by just a few voice commands.
